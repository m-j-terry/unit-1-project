# Frogger.io
- For my first project, I decided to recreate one of my favorite games from adolescence. Frogger was first released in 1981, developed by Konami and produced and released by Sega. I remember playing Frogger on one of the arcade machines at the roller rink just outside of town. Years later, I enjoyed the refreshing remake concept "Crossy Road". The logic seemed intricate but straightforward, and the prospect of a DOM-updating game was irresistable.

## v1
- My first version of this game was a 11 row gameboard with two levels and miltiple difficulty settings. The board was an array of arrays where each array was a gameboard row. Using .splice(), .pop(), .push(), .shift(), and .unshift(), I was able to create a playable game where frogger can cross rivers and roads to complete each level. You can find images of the levels below:

### Level 1: "river"

### Level 2: "road"

- For more on this project, you can refer to the [README](https://github.com/m-j-terry/unit-1-project/tree/v1/READMEfiles) from Version 1.

- After updating this game to incorporate some of the icebox elements (Scrolling gameboard, allowing for scaleable gameplay; score tracker; mixed gameboard, i.e. rivers and roads; etc.), I found that the game was having trouble rendering the DOM at the rate of the game interval because the way I had structured my game using arrays was using to store previous arrays and other information for a scaleable gameboard (such as direction and rowType, and seperate arrays to store previous directions and rowtypes), was using too much RAM. In order to address the issue of space complexity caused by manipulating too many arrays simultaneously, I restructured the game to run off of linked lists, which are less space complex.

## v2
### Level âˆž

- Much of the functionality and logic of the game is similar to v1. The `renderBoard()` function required the most restructuring. There are two ListClasses: `RowLinkedList` and `ColumnLinkedList`. The board is generated by creating a Row that is ColumnLinkedList, meaning it is a list of column nodes. And each of these is inserted into the RowLinkedList and saved as `board`.
