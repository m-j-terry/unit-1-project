## Future Updates
***Future Updates***
-Add an auto-scroll and random map generator that pushes newly, randomnly generated row arrays into the map array. 
-Add a score counter that goes up for each new row frogger makes it through. 
-Add a third row type for a street that frogger must go through. The logic rules would be similar to the regular dirt rules in that Frogger can jump anywhere on the roads, however, if one of the 'cars' iterating through the array hits frogger, (i.e. if frogger's space becomes occupied by a car) then Frogger is set = 0  and the game ends. Potential trouble shooting problems: How to keep Frogger in the same position as the array iterates to push the cars through.
